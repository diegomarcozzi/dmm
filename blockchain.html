							<h5>Revolutionizing User Experiences</h5>

							<p style=" margin-top: 0rem;">One of my most pivotal accomplishments has been the <b>complete redesign</b> of the <b>Exchange, Institutional, Explorer and the creation of a Chrome Extension</b>. This <b>comprehensive overhaul</b> encompassed every aspect of user interaction, from the initial sign-up process to compliance with local regulations for KYC/AML procedures. My team and I meticulously <b>streamlined processes such as prices, swap, staking, activity, buy, sell, send, receive, fiat currency withdrawal, web3 browser, onboarding, notifications, settings</b> for ios, android and web, including private key wallets and hosted wallets, with a particular focus on making them more modern, accessible for users without prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies, and above all: <b>user-friendly.</b> The result was a leaner, more intuitive user journey, with redundant content and steps eliminated to <b>enhance user engagement and satisfaction</b>. Also led the redesign of the <b>Exchange</b> app, giving it a modern and fresh appearance and adding complex features like <b>Margin trading, positions, collateral, simplified flows for trading, deposit, advanced charts and onboarding instructions</b>. The <b>Explorer</b> and <b>Institutional</b> were also <b>completely renovated and refreshed with new features.</b> This multifaceted approach ensured that our users had access to <b>cutting-edge features</b> while enjoying a <b>sleek and intuitive design.</b>

		<h4>Problem solving example #1: Rethinking the Wallet</h4>
		<p style=" margin-top: 0rem;">
			One of the first tasks I tackled was reevaluating the wallet feature. While it hadn't been explicitly requested, I identified several opportunities for enhancement. One prominent issue was the division between <b>Price</b> and <b>Buy/Sell</b> screens, which, in my opinion, lacked logical consistency since they essentially belonged on the same screen. Both screens displayed identical information, with the sole distinction being that one provided the choice to initiate buying or selling actions. As a result, I combined them into a unified interface.

		<h4>Problem solving example #2: Redefining the Explorer</h4>
		<p style=" margin-top: 0rem;">
			When I arrived at Blockchain.com, the Explorer posed significant challenges. It had been neglected, generated minimal profit, and was costly to maintain. Paradoxically, it remained the most popular product while being the least exploited. Few Explorer users were aware of the existence of our other, coincidentally more profitable offerings like Wallet, Exchange, and Institutional services.

		<p style=" margin-top: 2rem;">
			The previous version of the Explorer was solely dedicated to block exploration, offering limited information and displaying only a few coins. Recognizing the changing landscape, I felt the need to update it, even though no one had explicitly requested this. I decided to undertake this project during my available gaps, primarily because no other team was willing to allocate resources to it.		</p>

			Taking advantage of what I was learning while working on updating the Exchange and Institutional services,
			I began envisioning the new version of the Explorer as a top-tier professional tool, amalgamating the finest attributes from Glassnode, TradingView, CoinMarketCap, OpenSea and an array of other sources. My aim was to craft a comprehensive tool that went beyond just block exploration and offered robust block analysis capabilities, all while encompassing as many cryptocurrencies as possible and seamlessly integrating with our other products.

			I had an idea for improvement, but I wasn't entirely certain about its technical feasibility. To address my questions and concerns, I quickly created wireframes and scheduled a series of meetings with the Head of Institutional and the Tech Lead. My goal was to ensure that my proposal aligned with product requirements, legal considerations, and technical viability.

			My primary focus was on price generation. I needed to understand how prices were generated, what would happen if someone clicked within milliseconds, how price changes would be handled, and the details of locking prices and their duration.<br><br>
